# Simple-Search-Engine
To summarize the code in the Simple-Search-Engine repository:

Web Crawler: The code includes a web crawler that traverses web pages to collect data. This is likely implemented using Java, given your background in advanced Java.
Indexing: The collected data is then indexed to facilitate efficient searching. This involves parsing the web pages and storing relevant information in a structured format.
Search Algorithm: The search engine uses an algorithm to retrieve and rank results based on the userâ€™s query. This might involve techniques like keyword matching and relevance scoring.
User Interface: There is a simple user interface that allows users to input search queries and view the results. This could be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
